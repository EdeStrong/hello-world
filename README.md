# hello-world
My first GitHub repository as I set out on my coding journey! ⛵️
I've dabbled very lightly in HTML and CSS in the past, as well as being familiar with code and the process of software development from the position of a product owner.  But now I'm looking ahead and thinking that sofware development could be a great next step for me, one that will offer ongoing learning, challenges, flow-state work and a host of other things I'm excited about.
